Pip would like to ensure that requirements from pypi do not install dependencies from URLs.

The check for "domains_not_allowed" in the "comes_from" requirement caused an exception if there was no comes from URL,
or a default comes_from=None was set.  This bug has been removed.

This appears to resolve Issue 5889.
